# SPRM - Spatial Process & Relationship Modeling
Ted Zhang and Bob Murphy, Carnegie Mellon University
V1.0 March 1, 2021

## Description
SPRM is a statistical modeling program used to calculate a range of descriptors/features from multichannel cell images.  It uses these descriptors for clustering of cells and saves them for use for comparison and content-based search of the images.  It can be used with any type of multichannel 2D or 3D image (e.g., CODEX, IMS).

## Inputs

Two OMETIFF files from the output of CytoKit -
4D Multiplexed intensity Image (3D for multiple channels)
4D Indexed Image (3D for multiple segmentations) containing one channel for each type of segmentation (currently “cells”, “nucleus”, “cell membrane” and “nuclear membrane”).

## Execution: (assuming SPRM.py is in working directory)
```bash
[python_path] SPRM.py [img_dir_path] [mask_dir_path] [options_img_dir_path]
```

SPRM takes in three command line arguments that specify the path in the following order:\
Image directory path\
Mask directory path\
Options image file path
